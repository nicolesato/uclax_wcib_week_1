      I'm a designer and illustrator currently living in sunny Honolulu.
      Apart from art and creating, I love exploring nature, watching movies, and traveling.
      I'm using a Mid-2014 MacBook Pro.

      I followed Michael's detailed instructions and didn't encounter any serious errors setting up my local and hosting environment.
      That said, it's challenging to understand the "bigger picture" - for example, how the different programs (atom, git, node, grunt) work together to produce a website.
      Reading additional materials has helped me to gain a stronger foundation.
      In previous coding experience, interpreting and fixing errors was also challenging.
      I imagine practice is the best way to learn how to tackle errors!
